# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
This project was about working with Web APIs and asynchronous code, creating a web app that uses OpenWeatherMap API to get weather based on user's location, and dynamically update UI.

## Instructions
This will require modifying the `server.js` file and the `website/app.js` file. You can see `index.html` for element references, and once you are finished with the project steps, you can use `style.css` to style your application to customized perfection.

##Environment and Project Dependencies
 Install Node and Npm locally
 Run npm start to start express server and endpoints
 Requires middleware to use body-parser & cors
 
 
##Web API
OpenWeatherMap API

##Project Running
Enduser should enter a valid ZIP code

## Extras
If you are interested in testing your code as you go, you can use `tests.js` as a template for writing and running some basic tests for your code.
